This project solve a problem about Multi-label Text Classification through Multilabel Sentiment Analysis. In particular, the task is to predict the labels contained in a Tweet. \n
Dataset is the Multilabel Sentiment Analaysis dataset (SemEval-2018 Task 1)
This project will experiment 5 models, including:
1. TF-IDF + Naive Bayes: Utilizing the TF-IDF vectorization technique coupled with the Naive Bayes classifier provides a solid baseline. Naive Bayes is known for its efficiency and simplicity, making it well-suited for text classification tasks.
2. TF-IDF + SVM: SVMs excel in handling high-dimensional data and are particularly effective in scenarios where clear decision boundaries are crucial.
3. BiLSTM: BiLSTM is capable of understanding the sequential nature of textual data.
4. BERT + CNN: Integrating BERT embeddings with CNN introduces a powerful combination of pre-trained contextual embeddings and the ability to capture hierarchical features. This model is expected to excel in extracting intricate patterns.
5. BERT + LSTM: Merging BERT embeddings with LSTM enhances the modelâ€™s capacity to retain information over longer sequences.
After all compare the result to see which models exhibit superior performance in capturing the nuanced emotional expressions present in the dataset.
